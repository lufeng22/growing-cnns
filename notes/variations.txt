This is a list of all of the variations of the proposed method.

- Position of convolutional layer which doubles number of channels (before max pool or after
  max pool)
- Growth mode (linear, expandEdge, expandNode)
- Growth speed (expand all possibilities, expand only those from last growth step)
- Initialization of new layers (dirac, random weights)
- Join weighting (uniform weighting, sliding weighting, learned weighting)
- Join mode (weighted average, probabilistic sample, weighted sum)
- Whether or not to use different learning rates for different age layers
- Growth blocks (convolutional layer, resnet basic, resnet bottleneck, densenet, inception)
- Stopping criteria (fixed number of epochs, early stopping, convergence)
- Whether or not to copy batch norm parameters from previous layer

Training techniques:
- All the normal ones (batch norm, dropout, optimizer + optimizer params, etc)
- New regularization techniques (dropfilter, dropblock, droppath, stochastic depth)
-
